These assumptions will constitute the **inductive bias** of the learner. The no free lunch theorem tells us only that we need to induce a degree of bias to the learner. However, it does not tell anything about its consequences. Inducing too much bias limits the ability of the learner to explain the training observations.

The VC dimension builds on the notions of shattering, which in turn builds on the notion of growth function. Let us describe these notions stepwise and arrive at the definition of VC dimension.\n",
